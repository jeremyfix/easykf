Software/Hardware requirements
------------------------------

Supported operating systems
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The library has been developed and tested under Linux x86 with Fedora 14, 16. There is certainly no reason that it fails to compile under other Linux distributions. I actually don't know if it works on other operating systems.

Dependencies
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Gnu Scientific Library (GSL), 1.10 or + , see http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/
- Doxygen for building the documentation
- cmake  for compiling the library

Installation
------------

Manually
++++++++

Let's call ROOT_DIR the directory where the sources have been extracted so that you should already have the subdirectories ROOT_DIR/doc , ROOT_DIR/src , ROOT_DIR/examples ...

Compilation/Installation using cmake is done with :

- cd ROOT_DIR
- mkdir Build
- cd Build
- cmake .. -G"THE_GENERATOR"  <-- type cmake to check the available generators on your platform
  e.g. on Linux :  cmake .. -G"Unix Makefiles"
- make
- make install

This will build :
- the library libekf
- the pkf-config file easykf.pc
- the binaries for the examples easykf-example-xxxx
- the documentation

and install everything in $PREFIX_INSTALL/lib, $PREFIX_INSTALL/lib/pkgconfig, $PREFIX_INSTALL/bin, $PREFIX_INSTALL/share/easykf as well as the headers in $PREFIX_INSTALL/include/easykf

Packages manager
++++++++++++++++

Some distribution dependent packages are provided in the RPMs subdirectory of the svn
